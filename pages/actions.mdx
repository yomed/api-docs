# Actions

<span className="lead">
  Visually define the way your components respond to events
  in Framer.
</span>

<div>

Actions in Framer allow you to define how your components respond to events, such as a tap or hover. When a user selects an element on the canvas, any available events will appear on the right, under the Prototyping panel.

From here, they'll be able to choose one or more actions, such as navigating or opening a URL. By default, you have the option to choose between a set of built in actions:

- Open URL
- Log
- Navigate

Apart from the default actions, custom actions can also be added to accomodate for different setups.

</div>

## Custom Events

<div>

Custom events can be added to code components through [Property Controls](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls/) in Framer. Added events will appear in the Prototyping panel when selected.

To add a custom event to the Framer UI, use the `addPropertyControls` function, and give your event a `type` of `ControlType.EventHandler`.

</div>

```jsx
export function Button({ myCustomEvent }) {
  return <button onClick={() => myCustomEvent()} />
}

addPropertyControls(MyComponent, {
  myCustomEvent: { type: ControlType.EventHandler },
})
```

---

## Custom Actions

<div>

Framer also provides an API to create and attach your own custom Actions.

When using the `ActionHandler` type on a function, you'll see the option to attach this action in the Events UI panel on the right (after selecting an event).

</div>

```jsx
import { ActionHandler } from "framer"

export function customAction(): ActionHandler {
  return () => {
    console.log("I'm a custom action")
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  Custom actions can be used more than once, and can become
  complex. You can split these actions into a separate file
  to make them easier to maintain.
</Callout>

## Action Controls

<div>

Not only can you create custom actions, but you can make them more dynamic by giving your user control over what the events might actually do by using the `addActionControls` function.

To give your custom action Action Controls, import both the `addActionControls` function and the `ControlType` type from the `framer` library.

The Control Types you can add follow the same controls you can add through Property Controls. [Read more](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls/#adding-controls) about Property Controls to see what type of controls you can add to actions.

In this example, we've added a String Control Type to our `customAction` we created earlier. We can now use this through `props` within our Action Control.

</div>

```jsx
import {
  addActionControls,
  ControlType,
  ActionHandler,
} from "framer"

addActionControls(customAction, "Title", {
  text: {
    type: ControlType.String,
  },
})

export function customAction({ text }): ActionHandler {
  return () => {
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```
