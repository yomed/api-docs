# Upgrade to Motion 2

<span className="lead">
  How to upgrade Framer Motion from 1.x to 2.x
</span>

Framer Motion 2 is major release and that means there's API changes. In this guide we'll take a look at how you can upgrade your code to ensure it continues to work as expected, and highlight some features that will be broken in the new version of Motion.

## Layout animations

Framer Motion 1 supported a couple of ways to perform layout animations, the `positionTransition` and `layoutTransition` props.

```jsx
// Before
<motion.div layoutTransition />
```

In Framer Motion 2, these have both been superseded by the `layout` prop.

```jsx
// After
<motion.div layout />
```

Both of the old props used to take a transition as an argument.

```jsx
// Before
<motion.div layoutTransition={{ duration: 2 }} />
```

Now, layout animations use the same default `transition` prop as other animations.

```jsx
// After
<motion.div layout transition={{ duration: 2 }} />
```

In Framer Motion 1, layout animations could distort `borderRadius` and `boxShadow` properties on components that were changing size. This is now fixed if either property is animated.

```jsx
<motion.div layout initial={{ borderRadius: 20 }} />
```

<div>

Layout animations that changed size could also distort child components. This can now be corrected by providing them with a `layout` prop, too.

Only immediate children will need to be corrected for scale.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div layout>
  <motion.div layout />
</motion.div>
```

## Drag and useTransform

Drag has been refactored to use the same layout projection rendering methodology that powers Motion 2's layout animations to ensure the two features are fully compatible with each other.

It used to be possible to link the `x` transform and `opacity` using motion values and `useTransform`.

```jsx
const x = useMotionValue(0)
const opacity = useTransform(x, [-100, 0, 100], [0, 1, 0])

return <motion.div drag style={{ opacity, x }} />
```

This is still possible, but because the drag gesture no longer works with the x/y transform, this pattern no longer works.

Instead, in Motion 2.1, `layoutX` and `layoutY` props are exposed that accept motion values. These values will be updated with the latest x/y distance of the projected box from the actual layout box.

```jsx
const layoutX = useMotionValue(0)
const opacity = useTransform(
  layoutX,
  [-100, 0, 100],
  [0, 1, 0]
)

return (
  <motion.div drag layoutX={layoutX} style={{ opacity }} />
)
```

## Breaking changes

There are some changes that don't have an immediate fix that you should be aware of before upgrading.

### Drag

The changes to drag have resulted in the following further breaking changes:

- Drag listeners (like `onDrag`) now report the `point` relative to the viewport, moving in line with other pointer gestures in Motion.
- `dragOriginX` and `dragOriginY` have been removed. These were added to allow a hacky way to make `positionTransition` compatible with `drag`, but `layout` is compatible with `drag` by default.

### useAnimatedState

The `useAnimatedState` API was an experimental and undocumented API for use in Framer X. This has now been removed.
