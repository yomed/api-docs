# Animation

<span className="lead">
  How to animate in Framer Motion.
</span>

<div>

Animations in Framer Motion are controlled via the `motion` component's flexible `animate` property.

It can be used in a number of ways, scaling to the complexity of your needs.

In this guide, we'll explore each of them.

</div>

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <motion.div
    animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
    transition={{ duration: 2 }}
  />
)
```

---

## Target object

For simple animations, we can set values directly on the `animate` prop.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />
```

When any value in `animate` changes, the component will automatically animate to the updated target.

### Transitions

By default, Motion will create an appropriate animation for a snappy transition based on the types of value being animated. For instance, physical properties like `x` or `scale` will be animated via a spring simulation. Whereas values like `opacity` or `color` will be animated with a tween.

However, you can set different types of animation by passing a [`Transition` to the `transition` prop](/legacy/docs/motion/types#transition).

```jsx
<motion.div
  animate={{ x: 100 }}
  transition={{ ease: "easeOut", duration: 2 }}
/>
```

### Mount animations

When a component mounts, it'll automatically animate to the values in `animate` if they're different from those defined in `style` or `initial`. You can set the `initial` prop to `false` to use the value in `animate` as the component's mounted state to disable mount animations.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} initial={false} />
```

This will also work with server-side rendering.

### Keyframes

<div>

Values in `animate` can also be set as a series of keyframes. This will animate through each value in sequence.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div
  animate={{ stdDeviation: [0, 5, 0] }}
/>
```

<div>

By default, a keyframes animation will start with the first item in the array. To use the **current** value instead, `null` can be passed as a placeholder. This way, if a keyframes animation starts while the value is currently animating, the transition will be more natural.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.circle cx={500} animate={{ cx: [null, 100] }} />
```

<div>

Each of these keyframes will be spaced equidistantly throughout the animation, but you can override this by setting a `times` prop on the `transition` prop.

This is an array of the same length as the animation target with numbers between `0` and `1` that define when in the animation each keyframe should be hit.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.circle
  cx={500}
  animate={{ cx: [null, 100, 200] }}
  transition={{ duration: 3, times: [0, 0.2, 1] }}
/>
```

## Variants

Target objects are useful for simple, single-component animations. But sometimes we want to create animations that propagate throughout the DOM, and orchestrate those animations in a declarative way. We can do so with variants.

<div>

Variants are sets of pre-defined target objects.

</div>

```jsx
const variants = {
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}
```

<div>

They're passed into `motion` components via the `variants` prop.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div variants={variants} />
```

<div>

These variants can be referred to by label, wherever you can set an animation target.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial="hidden"
  animate="visible"
  variants={variants}
/>
```

### Propagation

<div>

If a `motion` component has children, changes in variant will flow down through the component hierarchy. These changes in variant will flow down until a child component defines its own `animate` property.

</div>

```jsx
const list = {
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}

const item = {
  visible: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -100 },
}

return (
  <motion.ul
    initial="hidden"
    animate="visible"
    variants={list}
  >
    <motion.li variants={item} />
    <motion.li variants={item} />
    <motion.li variants={item} />
  </motion.ul>
)
```

### Orchestration

<div>

By default, all these animations will start simultaneously. But by using variants, we gain access to extra `transition` props like `when`, `delayChildren`, and `staggerChildren` that can let parents orchestrate the execution of child animations.

</div>

```jsx
const list = {
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      when: "beforeChildren",
      staggerChildren: 0.3,
    },
  },
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    transition: {
      when: "afterChildren",
    },
  },
}
```

### Dynamic variants

Each variant can be defined as a function that resolves when a variant is accessed. These variant functions are provided a single argument, which can be set in a component's `custom` prop.

```jsx
const variants = {
  visible: i => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      delay: i * 0.3,
    },
  }),
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}

return items.map((item, i) => (
  <motion.li
    custom={i}
    animate="visible"
    variants={variants}
  />
))
```

## Component animation controls

Declarative animations are ideal for most UI interactions. But sometimes we need to orchestrate more complex sequences.

The `useAnimation` hook can be used to create a set of [imperative `AnimationControls`](/legacy/docs/motion/types/#animationcontrols) with a `start` and `stop` method. These controls can be passed to **one or more** `motion` components via the `animate` prop.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const controls = useAnimation()

  return <motion.div animate={controls} />
}
```

### Starting an animation

<div>

Animations can be started with the `controls.start` method.

</div>

```jsx
controls.start({
  x: "100%",
  backgroundColor: "#f00",
  transition: { duration: 3 },
})
```

`start` accepts either a `TargetAndTransition` or, if the component(s) it's provided to has a `variants` property set, a variant label.

```jsx
controls.start("hidden")
```

### Sequencing

`start` returns a `Promise`, so it can be used to sequence animations using `await` or `then`.

Different controls can be sequenced together, and these sequences can be composed into functions that themselves can then be sequenced.

```jsx
const sequence = async () => {
  await menuControls.start({ x: 0 })
  return await itemControls.start({ opacity: 1 })
}
```

### Dynamic `start`

`start` can also accept a function that can dynamically start each component and the controls are bound to with a different animation definition.

Custom data can be sent to this function via the component's `custom` prop.

```jsx
const controls = useAnimation()

useEffect(() => {
  controls.start(i => ({
    opacity: 0,
    x: 100,
    transition: { delay: i * 0.3 },
  }))
}, [])

return (
  <ul>
    <motion.li custom={0} animate={controls} />
    <motion.li custom={1} animate={controls} />
    <motion.li custom={2} animate={controls} />
  </ul>
)
```

## Animate single values

It's also possible to imperatively animate single values or a single `MotionValue` with the low-level `animate` function.

This function is for advanced use-cases where you want to animate a `MotionValue` without binding it to a component, or by using `animate`'s `onUpdate` method to modify the animated value in some way.

<APIFunction name="animate" skipnav />

---

## Layout animations

A `motion` component can automatically animate between different layouts that occur as result of a re-render by setting the `layout` prop to `true`.

```jsx
<motion.div layout />
```

Any layout change will be animated. That could be any combination of:

- Reordering of a list.
- A style set on the component itself, for example a change in `width` or `position`.
- A change in the parent's layout, e.g. flexbox or grid.
- Or any other change in the component's layout.

<div>

For example, this component is animated by switching `justify-content` between `flex-start` and `flex-end`:

<Button
  name="Open sandbox"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-2-layout-animations-kij8p"
/>

</div>

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-2-layout-animations-kij8p?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "400px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginBottom: 40,
  }}
  title="Framer Motion 2: Layout animations"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>

### Scale correction

All layout animations are performed using the `transform` property, resulting in smooth framerates.

Animating layout using transforms can sometimes visually distort children. To correct this distortion, the first child elements of the element can also be given `layout` property:

```jsx
<motion.div layout>
  <motion.div layout />
</motion.div>
```

<div>
  <Button
    name="Open sandbox"
    link="https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-2-scale-correction-z4tgr"
  />
</div>

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-2-scale-correction-z4tgr?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "500px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginBottom: 40,
  }}
  title="Framer Motion 2: Scale correction"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>

Transforms can also distort `boxShadow` and `borderRadius`. The `motion` component will automatically correct this distortion on both props, as long as they're set as motion values.

If you're not animating these values, the easiest way to do this is to set them via `initial`.

```jsx
<motion.div initial={{ borderRadius: 20 }} />
```

<Callout>
  <strong>Note:</strong> In a future release it'll also be
  possible to set these styles via `style` and they'll be
  automatically corrected.
</Callout>

### Customising layout animations

Layout animations can be customised using the `transition` property.

```jsx
<motion.div layout transition={{ duration: 0.3 }} />
```

<div>

Each axis can be animated seperately by naming `layoutX` and `layoutY` transitions.

Currently, `layoutX` and `layoutY` will animate the position **and** size of an axis simultaneously. In a future release it'll be possible to configure these separately.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div
  layout
  transition={{
    layoutX: { duration: 0.3 },
    layoutY: { delay: 0.2, duration: 0.3 },
  }}
/>
```

### Troubleshooting

#### The component's layout isn't animating

Ensure the component is set to `display: block` or `display: inline-block`, as `transform` has no effect on `display: inline` components.

#### SVG layout animations are broken

SVG components aren't currently supported with layout animations. This will be fixed in a future release.

#### Rotation and skew transforms aren't taking effect

For `rotate` support, the layout animation group must be wrapped in `AnimateSharedLayout`. `skew` transforms are not currently compatible with layout animations.

#### The content stretches undesirably

This is a natural side-effect of animating width and height with scale. Some elements, like those containing changing lengths of text, might be better animated with `layout="position"`, which only animates the position of the element.

## Shared layout animations

<div>

Wrapping components with <Link href="/pages/motion/animate-shared-layout.mdx">the `AnimateSharedLayout` component</Link> enables you to perform layout animations:

- Synced across a set of components that don't otherwise share state.
- Between different components with a common `layoutId` as they're added/removed.

</div>

```jsx
import { AnimateSharedLayout } from "framer-motion"
```

When one `layout` component in an `AnimateSharedLayout` changes layout, all other `layout` components check their own layouts and animate accordingly.

<div>
<Button
  name="Open sandbox"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-2-animating-shared-layouts-1cpd0"
/>

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-2-animating-shared-layouts-1cpd0?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "500px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginBottom: 40,
  }}
  title="Framer Motion 2: Shared layout animations"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>
</div>

```jsx
function List({ items, selectedId }) {
  /**
   * Local state changes in Item that affect layout will
   * also affect the parent motion.ul
   */
  return (
    <AnimateSharedLayout>
      <motion.ul layout>
        {items.map(item => (
          <Item {...item} />
        ))}
      </motion.ul>
    </AnimateSharedLayout>
  )
}
```

<div>

When a component with a `layoutId` prop is removed from one part of the tree and a new component with the same `layoutId` is added elsewhere, the new component will automatically animate from the old component's position.

<Button
  name="Open sandbox"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-2-animatesharedlayout-animate-between-different-components-dy0bv"
/>

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-2-animatesharedlayout-animate-between-different-components-dy0bv?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "500px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginBottom: 40,
  }}
  title="Framer Motion 2: Shared layout animations"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>
</div>

```jsx
function List({ items, selectedId }) {
  return (
    <AnimateSharedLayout>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li>
          {item.title}
          {item.id === selectedId && (
            <motion.div layoutId="underline" />
          )}
        </li>
      ))}
    </AnimateSharedLayout>
  )
}
```

The new component will also automatically inherit the current state of any animating values on the old component, and animate from those on entry.

```jsx
<motion.div
  layoutId="underline"
  animate={{ backgroundColor: item.color }}
/>
```

All `AnimateSharedLayout` options can be found in <Link href="/pages/motion/animate-shared-layout.mdx">the `AnimateSharedLayout` docs.</Link>
