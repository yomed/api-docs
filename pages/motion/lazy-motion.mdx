# LazyMotion

<span className="lead">
  Reduce bundle size by lazy-loading a subset of Motion's features.
</span>

<div>

The `LazyMotion` component can help you reduce bundle size by synchronously or asynchronously loading some, or all, of the `motion` component's features.

</div>

```jsx
import { LazyMotion, domAnimation, m } from "framer-motion"

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <LazyMotion features={domAnimation}>
    <m.div animate={{ opacity: 1 }} />
  </LazyMotion>
)
```

By default, the `motion` component comes pre-bundled with all of its features. The `m` component can be used in exactly the same way as `motion`, but it comes with no features preloaded. These are then provided by `LazyMotion`.

This can cut initial bundle sizes down to under 5kb.

Read the [Reduce bundle size](/api/motion/guide-reduce-bundle-size) guide for full usage instructions.
