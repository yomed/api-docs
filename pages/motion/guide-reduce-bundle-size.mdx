# Reduce bundle size

<span className="lead">
  Learn what makes up Motion's bundle size, and how to
  reduce it.
</span>

As of version 4.0, the full gzipped and minified size of Framer Motion is just under **30kb**.

However, modern JavaScript bundlers like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) are capable of "tree shaking", which means that only the code you import is shipped to consumers.

For example, if you're only importing `AnimatePresence` and `usePresence` to implement your own exit animations with CSS or a third-party library, you'd only add **1.4kb** to your bundle.

```jsx
import { AnimatePresence, usePresence } from "framer-motion" // 1.4kb
```

<Callout>
  <strong>Note:</strong> All sizes quoted in this guide are
  from Rollup -generated bundles. Webpack is less effective
  at tree-shaking and should generate slightly larger
  bundles.
</Callout>

The main import from Framer Motion is the `motion` component and, by default, this can add around **25kb** to your bundle.

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion" // ~25kb
```

Framer Motion's simple, props-driven API is the reason for this extra size. Unused features aren't tree-shaken, as it isn't currently possible to detect which features you're going to use at build time.

However, by using the `m` and `LazyMotion` components, we can bring this down significantly, to just under **5kb** for the initial render.

## How to reduce bundle size

Instead of importing `motion`, import the slimmer `m` component.

```jsx
import { m } from "framer-motion"
```

`m` is used in the exact same way as `motion`, but unlike `motion`, the `m` component doesn't come preloaded with features like exit animations or drag.

Instead, we load these in manually via the `LazyMotion` component. This lets you choose which features you load in, and whether you load them synchronously or asynchronously.

```jsx
import { LazyMotion, domAnimations } from "framer-motion"

// Load only the domAnimations package
function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <LazyMotion features={domAnimations}>
      {children}
    </LazyMotion>
  )
}
```

## Available features

There are currently two **feature packages** you can load:

- `domAnimations`: This provides support for animations, variants, exit animations, and tap/hover/focus gestures. (~13kb)
- `domMax`: This provides support for all of the above, plus pan/drag gestures and layout animations. (~18kb)

In the future it might be possible to offer more granular feature packages, but for now these were chosen to reduce the amount of duplication between features, which could result in much more data being downloaded ultimately.

## Synchronous loading

By passing one of these feature packages to `LazyMotion`, they'll be bundled into your main JavaScript bundle.

```jsx
import { LazyMotion, domAnimations } from "framer-motion"

function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <LazyMotion features={domAnimations}>
      {children}
    </LazyMotion>
  )
}
```

## Async loading

If you're using a bundler like Webpack or Rollup, we can pass a dynamic import function to `features` that will fetch features only after we've performed our initial render.

First, create a file that exports only the features you want to load.

```javascript
// features.js
import { domMax } from "framer-motion"
export default domMax
```

Then, pass `features` a function that will dynamically load that file.

```jsx
import { LazyMotion, m } from "framer-motion"

// Make sure to return the specific export containing the feature bundle.
const loadFeatures = () =>
  import("./features.js").then(res => res.default)

// This animation will run when loadFeatures resolves.
function App() {
  return (
    <LazyMotion features={loadFeatures}>
      <m.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      />
    </LazyMotion>
  )
}
```

## Developer tools

Because the normal `motion` component still preloads all of its functionality, including it anywhere will break the benefits of using `LazyMotion`.

To help prevent this, the `strict` prop can be set on `LazyMotion`. If a `motion` component is loaded anywhere within, it will throw with a reminder to render the `m` component instead.

```jsx
function App() {
  // This will throw!
  return (
    <LazyMotion strict>
      <motion.div />
    </LazyMotion>
  )
}
```
