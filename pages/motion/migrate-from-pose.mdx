# Migrate from Pose to Motion

<span className="lead">
  How to convert a Pose project to Framer Motion.
</span>

Framer Motion is the successor to the [Pose](https://popmotion.io/pose) animation library. Like Pose, it provides a declarative API to power animations and gestures in your React app. But Motion attempts to make the API even simpler for the simplest cases, yet more flexible to handle the most advanced.

In this guide we'll explain how to migrate a Pose project to Motion.

## What's missing?

First, it's important to outline what is missing from this new API, as this might be a blocker for you to upgrade your project.

The good news is that the only missing feature is the FLIP animation option. This allowed you to define an expensive, layout-changing prop like `height` or `top` and automatically convert it to a performant animation like `scaleY` or `y`.

```jsx
const Component = posed.div({
  visible: {
    height: 100,
    flip: true,
  },
})
```

In some cases, this was very useful. But it was the single biggest source of bugs in Pose, and the visual results often weren't what you expected.

Framer Motion does use FLIP techniques in its API, for instance its `positionTransition` feature, or its ability to animate values like `x` between different value types.

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ x: 0 }}
  animate={{ x: "calc(80vh - 50%)" }}
/>
```

But if we ever re-introduce this specific functionality, it'll be considered, and thoroughly tested.

## `posed` vs `motion`

The primary API change is that in Pose, components had to be pre-made outside the render function.

```jsx
const MyComponent = posed.div(config)
```

This proved to be very inflexible. In Motion, `motion` components are called directly within the render function itself.

```jsx
<motion.div />
```

## Poses vs variants

Poses exist in Framer Motion under the name "variants". In Pose, they had to be defined outside of the render function, pre-defined in a component.

```jsx
// Pose
const Posed = posed.div({
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
})

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Posed initialPose="hidden" pose="visible" />
}
```

Variants work in much the same way as poses, only now they can be defined anywhere and passed in via the `variants` prop.

```jsx
// Motion
const MyComponent = () => {
  const variants = {
    visible: { opacity: 1 },
    hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  }

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
      variants={variants}
    />
  )
}
```

Of course, in Framer Motion you only have to use variants if you're performing animations throughout the tree. Otherwise you can set props to `animate` directly.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ opacity: 0 }} />
```

## Dynamic poses

Each value within a Pose could be set as a function, to dynamically return a different value based on the props passed to that component.

```jsx
const Posed = posed.div({
  visible: {
    opacity: ({ target }) => target,
  },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
})

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Posed initialPose="hidden" pose="visible" target={1} />
  )
}
```

This came with the limitation that the pose itself couldn't be dynamic. The values themselves could change, but we couldn't return different poses with different values.

In Motion, because variants can be defined within the render function, it might be that you don't even need dynamic variants. But because the same `variants` definition can be used for multiple components, they are often still useful.

So in Motion, entire variants are dynamic, so they can return entirely different definitions based on the data received. This data is now passed through `custom` to ensure type safety for the rest of the component's props (as the previous approach required very permissive types).

```jsx
// Motion
const MyComponent = () => {
  const variants = {
    visible: target => ({ opacity: target }),
    hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  }

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
      variants={variants}
      custom={1}
    />
  )
}
```

## applyAtStart/applyAtEnd

Pose offered the `applyAtStart` and `applyAtEnd` for setting properties at the start and end of a transition.

```jsx
const Posed = posed.div({
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    applyAtStart: {
      display: "block",
    },
  },
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    applyAtEnd: {
      display: "none",
    },
  },
})
```

In Motion, non-animatable properties are automatically applied at the start of an animation. Anything that you want to be applied at the end can be set to `transitionEnd`.

```jsx
const variants = {
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    display: "block",
  },
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    transitionEnd: {
      display: "none",
    },
  },
}
```

## Durations

Durations and delays in Pose were set in milliseconds. In Motion, they're set in seconds.

```jsx
// Pose
const duration = 1000

// Motion
const duration = 1
```

## Transition

Orchestration props like `staggerChildren` have now moved underneath `transition`.

```jsx
const variants = {
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    display: "block",
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1,
    },
  },
}
```

In Pose, there were both `beforeChildren` and `afterChildren` boolean props. In Motion, there's just one: `when`. This can be set to either `"beforeChildren"` or `"afterChildren"`.

You can also set a default `transition` for a component via the `transition` prop.

```jsx
<motion.div transition={{ duration: 2 }} />
```

## Mount animations

In Pose, to animate a component on mount, you had to set the `initialPose` prop.

```jsx
<PosedComponent initialPose="hidden" pose="visible" />
```

In Motion, components will always animate on mount if the content of `animate` is different to `initial`, or the value read from the DOM (as set by CSS).

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ scale: 2 }} />
```

This mount animation can be suppressed by setting `initial` to `false`.

```jsx
<motion.div initial={false} animate={{ scale: 2 }} />
```

Unlike Pose, this initial state will also be rendered server side, so no more flashes of styles.

## Hoverable/Pressable

Pose provided shortcuts to animate a component while certain gestures were active. For instance to respond to hover gestures with an animation, you had to set `hoverable` to `true` and provide a `"hover"` pose.

```jsx
const PosedComponent = posed.div({
  hover: { scale: 1.1 },
  hoverable: true,
})
```

This had a couple of limitations in that the name of the hoverable pose **had** to be `"hover"`. Because of this, we couldn't use the presence of the `"hover"` pose to tell whether this specific component should respond to hovers, or we were just defining a pose to animate as a result of a hover over a parent component.

Instead, Motion provides the `whileHover` and `whileTap` props instead. These can be set either as an object of values, or the name of a variant.

```jsx
<motion.a whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }} />
```

## Draggable

In Pose, a component could be made draggable by setting its config to `draggable: true | "x" | "y"`. This was inconvenient because once defined, this configuration couldn't be changed.

```jsx
posed.div({ draggable: "x" })
```

In Motion, `drag` is a prop that can be changed like any other.

```jsx
<motion.div drag />
```

There was also a special `"drag"` pose to animate to while dragging was active. But in Motion the `whileTap` prop can be used, as this shares the same lifecycle.

## Drag boundaries

In Pose there was a `dragBounds` option that could define the boundaries of the draggable area. It could define top/left/bottom/right boundaries in pixels or a percentage.

In Motion, the `dragConstraints` prop can define boundaries only in pixels.

```jsx
<motion.div
  drag="x"
  dragConstraints={{ left: 0, right: 100 }}
/>
```

But now there's also the ability to pass in a `ref` to another component, and have that act as the drag constraints for this component. So if that component is styled responsively, the drag constraints will update when the viewport size changes.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const constraintsRef = useRef(null)
  return (
    <>
      <div ref={constraintsRef} />
      <motion.div drag dragConstraints={constraintsRef} />
    </>
  )
}
```

These constraints are enforced elastically now, but we can remove this effect by setting `dragElastic` to `0`.

```jsx
<motion.div
  drag
  dragConstraints={constraints}
  dragElastic={0}
/>
```

## Passive values

Pose allowed you to passively animate values based on the output of others.

```jsx
const Box = posed.div({
  draggable: "x",
  passive: {
    y: ["x", latestX => latestX * 2],
  },
})
```

You could attach values either to others on the same component, or those higher up the hierarchy via labels.

This could be useful but the strict hierarchal relationship was limiting and the use of labels created brittle, weak dependencies.

Motion tracks the state and velocity of every animating value <Link href="motion/motionvalue">with a `MotionValue`</Link>. Usually, it creates these by default, but by manually creating them they can be passed between components, and interesting relationships can be formed with <Link href="motion/motionvalue#usetransform">the `useTransform` hook</Link>.

```jsx
import {
  motion,
  useMotionValue,
  useTransform,
} from "framer-motion"

export const Box = () => {
  const x = useMotionValue(0)
  const y = useTransform(x, latestX => latestX * 2)

  return <motion.div drag style={{ x, y }} />
}
```

## PoseGroup

The final difference between the two libraries is the `PoseGroup` component. It provided three main functionalities:

- Unmount animations
- Reorder animations
- FLIP-powered unmount

This FLIP animation to unmount has been removed, again as it often lead to unexpected or weird results. It also wasn't often needed. However the other two have been split into specific functionalities.

### Unmount animations

There's a <Link href="motion/animate-presence">new component</Link>, `AnimatePresence`, that is responsible for unmount animations. It works in much the same way as `PoseGroup`, enabling the use of an `exit` prop that can either be an object or the name of a variant.

```jsx
<AnimatePresence>
  {isVisible && (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
    />
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

### Reorder animations

With `PoseGroup`, when an item was removed all of the other items would animate smoothly into their new place.

This has been evolved into a <Link href="motion/component/#animationprops.positiontransition">new prop called `positionTransition`</Link>, and it doesn't require the use of `AnimatePresence` to work (but they do work nicely together).

```jsx
<motion.div positionTransition />
```

It can be set either as a boolean for a default animation, or as a `Transition`.

```jsx
<motion.div
  positionTransition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 500 }}
/>
```

If defined, when the `motion` component changes position on a page as a result of the component re-rendering, it'll use this transition to animate smoothly to its new layout.

Paired with `AnimatePresence`, you have all the previous functionality of `PoseGroup`.

```jsx
<AnimatePresence>
  {items.map(item => (
    <motion.li
      key={item.id}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      positionTransition
    />
  ))}
</AnimatePresence>
```
